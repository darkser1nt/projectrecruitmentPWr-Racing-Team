Hi! 
I made this very quickly, and was on a very small time clock(stuck between shifts and tons of labs this week, the code should be mostly commented)
Made the task via Graham's scan algorithm, after reading and writing it finds the lowest point and then moving it,
I am doing first time anything on git so if there are issues with how I send, please send me a message, instead of silent treatment.
Would apreciate it a lot. 
I should have covered most edge-casses, but I have not had time to test a lot for a while, as in about half an hour I am off to a 12 hour shift, and my week was very full
Only did the second task, with 2 out of its 3 points, as that was how much time I had, finished commenting a few minutes ago, I think I understand the algorythm but you would be my judge!
Thank you for you time, and PS comments will explain most of my solution, and I need to run so please read them when looking for solution.
